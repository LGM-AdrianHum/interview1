/* Question:
    Imagine you are building a simple application to manage different types of vehicles
    in a parking lot. You have a base class Vehicle with common properties like Make, 
    Model, and Year, and you need to create specific classes for different types of 
    vehicles like Car, Motorcycle, and Truck. Each vehicle type may have unique 
    properties and methods. Using inheritance, demonstrate how you would design 
    the class hierarchy for these vehicle types and provide an example of how 
    you could use it to create and interact with different vehicles.
